# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This tic-tac-toe game was developed through the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly. The game uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create an engaging, interactive, cat-themed version of the classic game.


## Development Process
The game was developed in multiple phases:

1. Wire-framing and planning
  - I designed a couple sketch wireframes with pen and paper to identify what the game interface would generally look like
  - I drafted user stories to think about what players would want and need to be able to do in order for the game to be functional and enjoyable.
  - I drew a logic map of the different elements of the game and the different attributes and functions each element would have.
  - Check out images of my wireframes, user stories, and map on imgur:(http://imgur.com/a/jlX30)

2. Game logic development
  - HTML: I created a basic structure of the webpage to give myself an idea of what the game would look like, based on my wireframes
  - JavaScript: I started this process by pseudo-coding each of the steps that need to happen in order to carry out a players turn, a series of turns, and then a completed game
  - After breaking the code into pieces I tackled each step of the pseudocode and added in Javascript

3. API set-up
  - The API was the most challenging part for me. First, I identified each of the functions I would need my API to carry out.
  - I drafted code and tried executing it using a local server
  - I switched to the remote server and adjusted my code as necessary, which involved changing some parts of my HTML and Javascript for smooth functionality.

## Unsolved Problems
The game is mostly complete but still needs work on a few features:
1. Get Game History
  - This feature is currently not functioning, but when functional will allow users to see a history of games completed by the user.
2. CSS Design
  - The CSS Design has not been completed for a smooth and cohesive design. When complete, the game will be responsive and mobile-friendly and the design will be symmetrical and elements will be fixed in their position.

## Hopes for the Future
Looking forward, I hope to continue to work on this project to add the following features:
1. Select your own cat image: choose from a gallery of kitten pictures to select your player image.
2. Play from separate devices: allow for players to make moves on their own individual devices
3. Multi-player game history: track the results for both users in a multi-user game, whether on the same device or different devices
4. Reload incomplete games: restart a game that was previously unfinished
5. Timeout: timeout and save games that are incomplete and inactive
